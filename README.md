Jordan Deitsch's Data Structures Spring 2015 Final Project

- Project Summary
This project is designed with the intention of enabling the playing of a realistic game of blackjack with the additional feature of assisted card counting. The program will begin with the choice of the user to decide on the number of decks to be in use within the game. The number of decks in a blackjack game greatly affect the ability to count cards; one deack is easily counted, while seven or eight decks (as used in Las Vegas casinos) make for lower probability of achieving a "high count" before the dealer reshuffles. The game will then proceed as a standard game, with the player having the choice to hit or stay, double his bet, split his cards, and place varying bets. The dealer will be constrained to standard rules of the game, and the results of each hand in addition to the cards played that hand will be displayed for the player's convenience. At any time in the game the player will also have the ability to check on the "count" of the game. This count will be determined by the type of card counting system chosen by the player to follow at the beginning of the game. Types of card counting systems included will be the standard High-low, the Ken Uston system, and the Wong Halves. This ability to check the count can be used as either practice for the player's own attempts to count cards, or to influence their betting strategy during the game in an attempt to gauge the effectiveness of a certain system.
